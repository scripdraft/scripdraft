# Contributing to ScripDraft 

## Overview

This document will contains guidelines all of us use for contributing to the project, including project owners and team members.

## Poject Board

We organize our project using a Trello board at https://trello.com/b/0qRYFokv/scripdraft.  Anyone can view it, but only team members can edit it.

## Getting Involved

If you want to get in on this project, we could certainly use some backend talent. Contact Adam Cross for more info on that.  (@adamfgcross on Twitter, Xerocross on GitHub.)


## Guidelines for Team Members

When adding a new feature, you should create a new Git branch _from master_.  Give the branch a meaningful name describing what the changes are, like "update-text-in-header" or something like that.

There is a stage branch.  You may directly merge your changes into the stage branch.  Any changes you make to the stage branch will build automatically.  (Give it a few minutes.)  Then you can view the changes in a live environment at http://stage.scripdraft.com.  

When you are satisfied with your changes, create a PR to merge your branch into master, and raise it to the attention of the project owners, either Adam (Xerocross) or Kaan (kgokdemir).

The PR may not be accepted, but this creates a way for us to discuss the changes in an organied way, and it allows for back-and-forth discussion.  

## Guidelines for Potential New Contributors

Sorry.  I haven't really figured out how to do this yet.  We welcome others to get involved, so if you want to get involved, please just contact Adam Cross and we will figure it out.

## Project Owners

Currently the project owners are Adam (Xerocross) and Kaan (kgokdemir).
